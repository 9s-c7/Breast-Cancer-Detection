# Breast-Cancer-Detection

This project uses machine learning to predict breast cancer based on features of cell nuclei present in the breast cancer dataset.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression classifier that can accurately predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on certain features. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset obtained from Kaggle.

Dataset
The dataset contains 569 instances of tumors, with 30 features each. The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Project Structure
breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.
Requirements
The project requires the following Python packages:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
You can install these using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone 
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb
Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and results.
